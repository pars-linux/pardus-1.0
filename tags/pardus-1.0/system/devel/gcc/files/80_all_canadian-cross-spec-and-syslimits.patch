When doing a canadian cross-compile, the fixincludes tool is disabled and 
thus the syslimits.h header file is not installed.  So we install the default 
template (gsyslimits.h) in that case.

Also, we disable the default spec generation step because the specs file 
comes from the cross-compiler which is building the cross-compiled gcc rather 
than the cross-compiled gcc itself.  This is OK because the specs files is 
simply a copy of the settings built into gcc itself.

Note:
We use the STMP_FIXINC variable to determine whether we are in cross canadian 
mode or not because configure.ac will only unset it in that case ($build != 
$host).
