+General Notes
+-------------
+
+In this package, 'uncompress' is installed as 'uncompress.real' to avoid
+conflict with the gzip package.  Most of the utility scripts distributed with
+the source code (zdiff, zmore, zcmp) are not installed.
+
+The uncompress.real program installed to /usr/bin is just a symlink to the
+compress program.  Same goes for the uncompress.real manpage in
+/usr/share/man/man1.
+
+Please note that this version of ncompress does not support files larger than
+2GB.  I have toyed with increasing this limit, but I haven't been overly
+successful.  It looks to be possible to increase the limit up to 4GB, but
+that's still an arbitrary limit, and given my level of understanding of this
+code, I'm leery of doing it for no real gain.  If you need support for very
+large files, I suggest using gzip rather than compress.
+
+Also, note that prior to fixing bug #220820 (in November of 2003, version
+4.2.4-13), there was a data-corruption bug with 'compress -b9'.  If you created
+files using -b9 (maxbits of 9) prior to this version, your file was probably
+corrupted, and you will only be able to recover parts of it.  I have "fixed"
+this bug by disallowing maxbits less than 10.  The uncompress.real program will
+still decompress 9-bit files created by other compress programs (such as the
+ones from Solaris or AIX) but the compress program will not create 9-bit files.
+
+This package was moved to main in August of 2004.  Prior to that, it was kept
+out of main because it implements the patented LZW algorithm.  The consensus is
+that patents on that algorithm have expired as of July 2004.
+
+
+Upstream Source Code
+--------------------
+
+Christoph apparently downloaded the original tarball from:
+
+   ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/linux/utils/compress/ncompress-4.2.4.tar.Z
+
+In the meantime, however, sunsite.unc.edu has disappeared, and has been
+replaced by ibiblio.org, so the current URL is:
+
+   ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/linux/utils/compress/ncompress-4.2.4.tar.Z
+
+This probably doesn't matter much at all, since there hasn't been a new
+"upstream" release in more than 10 years.  In any case, the contents of the
+packgae orig.tar.gz file match exactly with the contents of the file currently
+on ibiblio.org.
+
+
+Copyright and Patent Discussion
+-------------------------------
+
+The following article is from James A. Woods, one of the earlier authors of
+compress.  The article discusses the Unisys patent on the LZW compression
+method, and how that affects ncompress.

+#  "The chief defect of Henry King
+    Was chewing little bits of string."
+
+        -- Hilaire Belloc, Cautionary Tales [1907]
+
+     As a co-author of 'compress' who has had contact with an attorney for
+Unisys (nee Sperry), I would like to relay a very basic admission from Unisys
+that noncommercial use of 'compress' is perfectly legal.  'Compress' is also
+commercially distributed by AT&T as part of Unix System 5 release 4,
+with no further restrictions placed upon the use of the binary, as far
+as I am aware.
+
+     From conversations with Professor Abraham Lempel and others, it 
+appears that neither AT&T, Sun Microsystems, Hewlett Packard, nor IBM
+are paying any sort of license fees to Unisys in conjunction with patent
+#4,558,302.  It may be true that some organizations are paying fees for
+data compression technology licensed from one or more of the many holders
+of compression patents, but this is all independent from 'compress'.
+
+     In particular, I received a letter at NASA dated October 1, 1987 from
+John B. Sowell of the Unisys law department, informing me for the first
+time that some form of LZW was patented.  I naturally expressed
+skepticism that an algorithm could be patented (a murky legal area
+which remains so), stated that 'compress' is not identical to LZW,
+and in fact was designed, developed, and distributed before the ink
+on the patent was dry.  Several telephone conversations later, Mr. Sowell
+intimated that they would *not* seek any fees from users of 'compress'
+but instead were signing licensees for hardware implementations of LZW.
+
+     So, regardless of what you believe about a shady legal area, if anyone
+from Unisys contacts you to extract tribute for the use of 'compress', please
+tell them that, first, it is not theirs to begin with, and, second, there is
+someone who will testify in court about the conversation above.
+It is not even clear if anyone can "own" 'compress', since original developer
+Spencer Thomas, myself, and others placed the code in the public domain
+long before the adoption of the Berne copyright convention.
+
+     In light of the events above, it seems that the Free Software
+Foundation is being unduly paranoid about the use of 'compress'.
+Now I can well believe that FSF is more likely to be a legal target
+than a behemoth like AT&T, but if they are simply redistributing
+untouched free software developed years ago in the public sector,
+I see no problem.
+
+     Aside:  I am investigating, possibly for a case history to be
+recycled to USENET, the particulars of data compression patents.
+I am aware of the following patents: IBM's Miller-Wegman LZ variant,
+those of Telcor and ACT [losing candidates for the British Telecom modem
+standard], James A. Storer's work on limited lookahead as explicated in his
+text "Data Compression (methods and theory)", Computer Science Press, 1988,
+and the various patents pending associated with the Fiala and Greene
+CACM article of April, 1989 on textual substitution methods.
+If you have any lore, send it this way.
+
+
+
+                    Sincerely,
+
+                    James A. Woods
+                    NASA Ames Research Center (RIACS)
+                    jaw@riacs.edu (or ames!jaw)
+
+
+P.S.  The algorithm patent issue certainly is a "topic A" at the moment.
+One useful reference is the review article by Anthony and Colwell --
+"Litigating the Validity and Infringement of Software Patents" in
+Washington and Lee Law Review, volume 41, fall 1984.  I know Robert Colwell
+personally.  As a practicing patent attorney, he tells me that, at a minimum,
+use of an invention "for research purposes" is legitimate.

+Description: Original Lempel-Ziv compress/uncompress programs
+ This package provides the original programs that are the de facto standard, in
+ much of the UNIX community, for compressing and uncompressing files.  The
+ programs implement a fast, simple LZW file compression algorithm.  The LZW
+ algorithm does not have as high a rate of compression as some other
+ algorithms, but LZW implementations such as this one often compress files
+ faster than other, similar programs such as gzip.
+ .
+ For Debian, the standard uncompress program is installed as uncompress.real.
+ .
+ This package contains a copyright notice from one of the original authors in
+ the file /usr/doc/ncompress/README.Debian.
